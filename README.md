# currconverter
using c++ language I have always found interesting to convert currencies ,so made a currency converter which offers 4 currencies to convert ->dollar, rupees ,euro & pounds ,so basically in this I have used 4 alphabets -> a,b,c&d which are the currency names respectively ,and the code starts with asking your permission to start for which we have to type 's', and then it asks currency1 name and currency1 value , moving on to get a converted answer it asks currency2 name and currency2 value and finally gives the result after displaying the result it asks ypur permission to use it again if yes then 'y' if no then 'n' and it continues if we enter 'y' if not the code terminates by concluding Thank you for using my application! .
